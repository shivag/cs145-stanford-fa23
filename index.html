        <h2>Honor Code/Collaboration Policy</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Students must adhere to <a href="https://communitystandards.stanford.edu/policies-and-guidance/honor-code">The Stanford Honor Code</a> 
          and <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1164/handouts/honor-code.pdf">The Stanford Honor Code</a> as it  pertains to CS courses.
        </p>
        <p>
          We encourage students to form study groups. Students may discuss and work on homework problems in groups. 
          However, each student must write down the solution independently, and without referring to written notes from the joint session. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It is an honor code violation to copy, refer to, or look at written or code solutions from a previous year, 
          including but not limited to: official solutions from a previous year, solutions posted online, and solutions 
          you or someone else may have written up in a previous year. Furthermore, it is an honor code violation to post 
          your assignment solutions online, such as on a public git repo.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The teaching staff will be using plagiarism detection software and if we have reason to believe that you are in 
        violation of the honor code, we will follow the university policy to report it.

        <p>
          <b>Group Size</b> The first two projects are individual only, but the third project you are allowed
          to work in teams of two.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Project Submissions</b>
          You will submit your projects via Gradescope. You should have been automatically signed up for gradescope.

          Each assignment will include specific instructions regarding what
          files to submit.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Regrade Policy</b>
          If you think that we've made a grading mistake or that the work
          you submitted should be regraded, submit a regrade request on
          Gradescope within one week of receiving your grade. Be sure that you
          prepare a short and convincing argument on Gradescope about why you
          think your work was incorrectly graded – we reserve the right to
          ignore your regrade request if you don't provide a justification.

          If you submit a regrade request, we reserve the right to regrade your
          entire assignment. This means that your overall score could go
          down.
